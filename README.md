## Description

This p5.js project demonstrates a simple multi-screen game structure using a state-based approach. The purpose of the game is to roll a die. If an odd number is rolled, the player loses, but if an even number is rolled, the player wins. It includes a start screen featuring an image of dice, an instruction screen explaining how to play, a basic game screen prompting the user to roll the dice, and win/lose outcome screens. The focus is on showing how to separate screens into different files, route input based on the current game state, and design simple UI elements such as buttons and keyboard controls.

- Practice separating code across multiple files for readability and maintenance
- Implement clickable and keyboard-accessible UI buttons
